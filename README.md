_Take a birthday and make some art!_

## What is this?

This is the repository for the Data Art workshop that I did at the Curtain Raiser for DesignUp 2017. This hands-on workshop was used as a follow up to my talk introducing each type of medium of data with a few examples.

## Why birthdays?

Birthdays are unique to each person, and we _(try to!)_ remember birthdays of those closed to us as well ‚Äî thus making them a personal yet easy to use dataset. It also leads to interesting conversations _(‚ÄúHow does your birthday look like?‚Äù)_ and a visual exploration can exhibit interesting patterns _(‚ÄúLooks like you were born in the same year!‚Äù)_.

## What‚Äôs next

The workshop was focused on doing things by hand (inspired by the [Conditional Design workshops](https://conditionaldesign.org/)), thus removing the barrier to know programming for designing systems and creating data art. But creative coding can enable you to create much more, and I‚Äôll be exploring this next.
